## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Process Array
In task 1, you must create a function named `processArray` that accepts an array of numbers. Each even integer in the array is squared, and each odd number is multiplied by three by the function. After that, the processed array is given back.

### Task 2: Format Array Strings
This task involves creating a function called `formatArrayStrings` that takes two arrays: one of strings and one of numbers. The function formats each string to uppercase if the corresponding number is even and to lowercase if the number is odd. The formatted strings are returned as a new array.

### Task 3: Create User Profiles
We are to create a function named `createUserProfiles` that accepts two arrays—one containing the original names and the other containing the updated names. Each object in the array that the method returns has a `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1), a `originalName`, and a `modifiedName`.
